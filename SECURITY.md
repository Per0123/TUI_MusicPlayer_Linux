# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you believe you've found a security-related issue (even though this project is an offline MP3 player and has very limited attack surface), you can report it by emailing:

**petar.filo@gmail.com**

I aim to respond within 72 hours.

## Supported Version
This project currently has only one maintained version. Please report issues affecting the latest release.

## What to Report
Because this is an offline music player that only handles local files, there are very few security concerns. However, please report:
- Crashes caused by specific files
- Unexpected or abnormal behavior
- Anything that might indicate unsafe file handling

## Reporting Process
1. Email your report to **petar.filo@gmail.com**.
2. I will acknowledge your message within 72 hours.
3. I will investigate the issue and coordinate any necessary fixes or disclosure.

## Bug Bounty
Although this project has low security risk and I cannot offer monetary rewards, I still appreciate responsible disclosure.  
As a thank-you, I offer:
- Public acknowledgment in a `THANKS.md` file
- Early access to new features or updates
- Occasional custom digital goodies (icons, wallpapers, etc.)

Exceptional reports may receive additional appreciation.
